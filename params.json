Generates Classes in Java.","body":"# CodePaw Wiki\r\n\r\n![CodePaw avatar](https://kenai.com/attachments/wiki_images/codepaw/avatar.png)\r\n\r\n## General\r\nCodePaw is a project inspired by the [CodeFu](http://codefu.com.mk/Home.do) programming competition. It's aim is to save as much time as possible, by generating a main function that runs all the test cases, meanwhile examines the running time and the return values of the method that needs to be programed, and even more, if the method doesn't end in 10 seconds (CodeFu's time limit is 5) the thread working on the method is being terminated.\r\n\r\n##The Program\r\nUsing the program is easy and intuitive. You are coping the problem description into the upper text field, and than click the generate button. Dependant weather you've chosen the main function to be in separate class or in the same class as the function you'll need to code for the competition different codes are generated. In the first case, a code for a \"Main\" class and a main function is generated, where on the other hand a code for a class named as the one containing the needed method is generated, with the needed signature of the asked method and the already mentioned main method.\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://kenai.com/attachments/wiki_images/codepaw/Screenshot-CodePaw.png)\r\n\r\nRoughly the autogenerated code weights from 200-220 lines of java code. \r\nThe program actually looks like the picture on the left, with interface easy to use, and the hotkeys for copy and paste overriden, and CTRL+G added for generate. CTRL+C always copies the contents of the lower text field and paste always pastes the clipboard contents into the upper field.\r\n\r\n##The Author\r\nI am Stefan Spasovski, and if you have any suggestions bug reports or you're in need of contact for any reason, feel free to mail at [my mail](mailto:me@stefs.me)\r\n\r\n##Links\r\nThe old project (Prevoius versions)\r\n* [on project Kenai](http://kenai.com/projects/codepaw)\r\n\r\nMy personal Page\r\n* [stefs.me](http://stefs.me)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
